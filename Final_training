Once roundabout.py has been run we need to start training the classifier

First do this in the terminal:

opencv_createsamples -info info/info.lst -num 1950 -w 20 -h 20 -vec positives.vec


Creates a .vec file with the positive images 

Make a directory called data
(mkdir data)
Then run:

opencv_traincascade -data data -vec positives.vec -bg bg.txt -numPos 1800 -numNeg 900 -numStages 10 -w 20 -h 20

This produces the final xml file
Running through more stages takes more time but produces accurate results
